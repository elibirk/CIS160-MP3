Practice using switch statements in C.

In this program, a user enters a number between 100 and 300. Then, the program counts from 0 to the inputted number. With each number the program counts, the program does something based on the remainder of the inputted number divided by the counting number. If the remainder is 0, the program determines if the inputted number is odd or even and prints the results. If the remainder is 1, the program prints out the square of the input. If the remainder is 2, the program prints out a message showing how many times the program has looped. If the remainder is 3, the program prints out the sum of the numbers accepted as inputs. If the remainder is 4, the program prints out the average of the number accepted as inputs. If the remainder is 5, the program prints out a line of asterisks equal to the smaller of the number input or 20. If the remainder is 6, the program prints out a message indicating that modulo 6 was selected. If there is any other remainder value, the program prints “End condition has been met” and then exits the program. If the program does not end because of the remainder result, then the program asks the user if they want to try a new number. If they say yes, it runs again, if they say no the program exits.
